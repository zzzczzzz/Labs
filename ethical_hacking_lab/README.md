# Ethical Hacking ‚Äì Manual Techniques and Offensive Labs

This project showcases hands-on ethical hacking techniques performed in a controlled lab environment. The labs simulate real-world attack scenarios across web applications, services, networks, and mobile platforms.

## Key pointed out Labs

These are the most impactful and technically relevant labs in this project:

1. **Stored XSS & SQL Injection**
   - Demonstrated successful exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities.
   - Performed union-based SQL injection to extract system information and files.
   - Injected persistent JavaScript to simulate cookie theft and UI manipulation.

2. **Web Vulnerability Scanning (Skipfish & Uniscan)**
   - Automated scanning to uncover issues like XSS vectors, hidden directories, no CSRF protection.
   - Analyzed real HTTP responses and server configurations.
   - Emphasized importance of patch management and secure design.

3. **DNS Enumeration & Passive Recon**
   - Compared `theHarvester` and `Sublist3r` for domain discovery.
   - Identified VM's DNS records, subdomains, and email servers using DNSDumpster.
   - Highlighted attacker reconnaissance techniques.

4. **Exploiting Outdated Apache & Samba Services**
   - Identified vulnerable Apache version (1.3.20) and mapped CVEs.
   - Used ExploitDB to find relevant public exploits.
   - Delivered payload via web service and gained access to Windows lab machine.
   - Demonstrated post-exploitation with commands like `shutdown` and `zombies 0`.
   - Emphasized importance of patch management and exploit-based attack vectors.
