# Ethical Hacking ‚Äì Manual Techniques and Offensive Labs

This project showcases hands-on ethical hacking techniques performed in a controlled lab environment. The labs simulate real-world attack scenarios across web applications, services, networks, and mobile platforms.

## Key pointed out Labs

These are the most impactful and technically relevant labs in this project:

1. **Stored XSS & SQL Injection**
   - Demonstrated successful exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities.
   - Performed union-based SQL injection to extract system information and files.
   - Injected persistent JavaScript to simulate cookie theft and UI manipulation.

2. **Android Malware Creation using msfvenom**
   - Crafted a malicious APK with embedded Meterpreter payload.
   - Deployed on an Android emulator; achieved remote shell via backdoor connection.
   - Showed potential for mobile surveillance and control.

3. **Brute Forcing Services (VNC, Postgres, MySQL)**
   - Used Hydra and custom wordlists to gain access to exposed services.
   - Extracted credentials and verified remote access through cracked services.
   - Illustrated risks of weak passwords and exposed ports.

4. **Web Vulnerability Scanning (Skipfish & Uniscan)**
   - Automated scanning to uncover issues like XSS vectors, hidden directories, no CSRF protection.
   - Analyzed real HTTP responses and server configurations.
   - Emphasized importance of patch management and secure design.

5. **DNS Enumeration & Passive Recon**
   - Compared `theHarvester` and `Sublist3r` for domain discovery.
   - Identified VM's DNS records, subdomains, and email servers using DNSDumpster.
   - Highlighted attacker reconnaissance techniques.
